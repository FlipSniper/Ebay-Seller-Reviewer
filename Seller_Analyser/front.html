<h1> Welcome to the Ebay Seller Analyser<h1>
<h2> I will help you analyse all the seller reviews you'll ever need</h2>
<h2>You may be wondering hmmmm why would I use this</h2>
</body> Well did you know that <b>60%</b> of time spent shopping online is spent on reading reviews?</body>
<p>Yep... which is why I've created this amazing tool that combines approved ebay scraping<p>
<p>Which takes advantage of ebay's free API keys and some illegal scraping (;<p>
<p>Basically how this works is that I use an NLP using my CPU not CUDA ðŸ˜” and it goes through my different categories I have and decides wether<p>
<p>It fits any of the categories(damaged,bad seller, refunds, good experience, bad experience, lost delivery, late delivery, poor shipping)<p>
<p>The data may not always be accurate as there are times where the scarper may get a different username of the seller as ebay being ebay<p>
<p>Thought it would be a good idea to give users multiple usernames...<p>
<p>They probably did it to get people like me away from scraping their site<p>
<s2>If I figured out how to use widgets and stuff in HTML I would show you but I have no idea how to do that</s2>
